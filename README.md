# Book Recommender System

End-to-end machine learning project for a book recommender system using collaborative filtering. This recommender system is based on user-item interactions and is deployed using Flask for a website.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is collected from Kaggle and can be found at the following link: [Book Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset).

## Project Overview

This project implements a collaborative filtering-based recommender system for suggesting books to users based on their preferences and interactions with the system. The system employs machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and predict book recommendations.

## Features

- Collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
- Flask application for deploying the recommender system on a website.
- Utilizes a dataset with user-book interactions from Kaggle.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhnafTahmid1776/Book-recommender-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Book-recommender-system
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage
